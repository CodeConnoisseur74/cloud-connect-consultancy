## Introduction
World Weather is a weather website where the user can search for the current weather by city. The background image correspods with a random image of that city is fetched from unsplash.com. Current weather information includes: temprature in celcius, cloud status, humidity and windspeed. This weather data is fetched from openweatherapp.org. The site allows the user to quickly access current weather information of any major city worldwide whilst a corresponding image is provided to the user in realtime. The site is responsive to any size desktop, tablet or smartphone device.

## Updates

* Fixed responsiveness in CSS with adding: background-size: cover;
  background-position: center, center; to the body element in styles.css.

* Fixed Favicon error by utilizing ![favicon.io](![Weather Home Page Search Results](assets/images/weather-home-london.png))

* Fixed links opening up into new windows by removing the lines rel='noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" from index.html.

* Git commits were too few and not detailed in the description. The updated version has well written commits that are more detailed and easier to follow.

* Comments are added to styles.css
